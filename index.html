		<h2>MLIS Candidate</h2>
		<p>I am a current MLIS student at Western University. I am hoping to secure an internship (and once I graduate, a permanent position) at a public library in Ontario. I am eager to explore the possible ways in which public library services can benefit both a community, and individuals within that community.</p>
		<p>I am on a personal mission to correct the Canadian pronunciation of every non-British person I meet. But in the nicest way possible. The rest of my time is spent convincing my cat to cuddle with me.</p>
